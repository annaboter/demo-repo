Fooling around with Git and Github to get familiar with it!


## Update

I figured out how to add my own ssh key and link it with Github + VScode. Turns out in VScode, it tracks changes when I make a new file in a cloned repository (such as this one) but doesn't automatically recognize a change made in a cloned file (for example this readme file). I have to manually save it on my device for git to notice a change made and then I can git add ., commit to main branch and push origin main.
